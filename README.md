# Pawsome Gallery üêæ

Welcome to **Pawsome Gallery**! üê∂üé® This project is a fun and interactive way to explore different dog breeds and view images of them. Browse through a list of dog breeds, select one, and navigate through beautiful images of that breed. Built using **React**, this app fetches data from the **Dog CEO API**.

## Features

- **Explore Dog Breeds**: View a list of available dog breeds in the gallery.
- **Breed Image Gallery**: Select a breed to view a collection of images for that breed.
- **Image Navigation**: Navigate through images of the selected breed using 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use and visually appealing with smooth transitions between images.

## How It Works

Pawsome Gallery uses **React** for the user interface and **fetch** to make API requests. Upon loading, the page fetches a list of dog breeds from the Dog CEO API. After selecting a breed, images related to that breed are fetched and displayed. You can then switch between the images using the navigation buttons.

### API Used

We‚Äôre utilizing the **Dog CEO API** to retrieve breed data and images. Here are the key endpoints:

- **Breeds List**: `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all` - Fetches all available breeds.
- **Breed Images**: `https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images` - Fetches images for a specific breed.

## Example JSON Response

Here is an example of a JSON response from the Dog CEO API for testing purposes:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": {
    "bulldog": [],
    "labrador": []
  }
}
```
